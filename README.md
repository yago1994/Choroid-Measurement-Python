#  ⚠️ This program is under development ⚠️

# How to use this program

Requirements
- Jupyter Notebook -> Install Jupyter Notebook first from https://jupyter.org/

Then use:

```$ pip install -r requirements.txt```

To pull all the dependencies you need to run

# Run

In Terminal

```$ cd PATH_TO_YOUR_DIRECTORY/Choroid-Measurement-Python```

```$ jupyter notebook```

This should launch your brower and initiate a Jupyter Session. Click on main.py

1. With main.py open you want to run all the cells below analysis() 

2. To run the cells you can go to 'Cells' > 'Run all below'

3. Wait for all the cells have run (there won't be any * marks on the left)

4. **For Drawing**: Run the main() cell

5. A window will appear with the sample image for analysis. Click with your mouse on it to draw the boundary
